# RTCoreDataStack
WiP: Core Data stack I use in all my modern iOS apps

* Demo project is useless so far, need to find time to write a proper demo of how I use the library.
* The library itself is now fully commented in the header

I am using this library in two large and complex apps, with lots of background use, thus it's fairly stable and usable in practice. Still, test all assumptions like hell.
